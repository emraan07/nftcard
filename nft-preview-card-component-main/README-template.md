## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I've learned the html semantics and how to show an item on hover using opacity only.

```html
<article class="main-image">
  <img src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium Image" />
  <div>
    <img src="images/icon-view.svg" alt="" />
  </div>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Equilibrium #3429</h2>
</article>
```

```css
.container .main-image div {
  position: absolute;
  cursor: pointer;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: calc(100% - 4px);
  /* text-align: center; */
  background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  border-radius: 10px;
  z-index: 999;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in;
}
.container .main-image div img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 37%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, 50%);
}
.container .main-image div:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

-- Needs to work on html semantics, as I've found out that it makes the code clean and also less amendmends needed in design.

-- Needs to work on transform: translate() property to fully understand the concept

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8) - This video helped me in html semantics. I really liked this pattern and will use his methods in future projects.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3shools.com) - This website helped in understanding the html concepts very easily.
